## BoilerPlate

This project hosts boiler plate code for tartJS. In other words, it's the basic code and directory structure if you would like to use tartJS in your projects.

## How to turn into actual code

This code assumes you have a namespace for your project. Let's say if it's foo.

Find all "BoilerPlate" texts in the code (case sensitive) and replace them with "foo", and you're good to go.
